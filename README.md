Background

This paper is a epidemiological study with the aim to understand and predict tinnitus perception and severity over time

Study highlights:
By using machine learning algorithm in a large cohort (n=190,000, UK Biobank dataset), this study identified key predictors of tinnitus onset and progression. It highlights for the first time hearing health as the primary risk factor for tinnitus perception, 
while hearing health, mental health and sleep disorders predict tinnitus severity but also its progression. Based on this model, we developed the POST questionnaire (Prediction Of the Severity of Tinnitus) to predict the evolution of tinnitus severity over time. 
This questionnaire represents a significant advancement and a practical tool in identifying individuals at risk of severe tinnitus, for which early supportive care would be crucial.
